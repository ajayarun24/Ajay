**1. Leading Question**

With spring break coming up, many students/families are planning road-trips for some

bonding time with their loved ones! To help them out in this venture we aim to create a tool to

answer the following question: what is the most efficient route to get from point A to point B

**AND** see the pit-stop at the best sightseeing areas? A successful implementation of this tool will

output the shortest path between two inputted locations in the United States, and additionally

print the best tourist locations and their costs along this route!

**2. Dataset Acquisition and Processing**

We will use a dataset of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States and their

locations, we will download the data from

<https://www.touristmaker.com/blog/100-sights-in-usa/>, and convert the 100 places mentioned in

this article into an excel spreadsheet with the destination’s name, location(longitude and

latitude), and average cost of visiting of that city. Once this data is into the excel spreadsheet we will convert it

into a csv file to make it easily parseable. We will parse this data against a map of the United

States, and given an input starting and stopping point, develop an algorithm to create the quickest

route with the best sight-seeing locations. The most important information to

build our graph will be the distance which we can get for all data points using map software,

meaning there can be no errors on it.

**3. Graph Algorithms**

Our road trip planner algorithm will take in two graph data algorithms: it will firstly

construct a map of our desired region (the United States) by identifying which state will be

connected to the previous state with their edges based on their bordering state options (Kruskals), secondly, it will find the shortest possible path from the start to end location using

Dijkstra’s algorithm (most efficient road-trip route). Since we will be using priority queues

(starting and ending points) in our Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation, the runtime will be

O(E + n(log(n)), where E is the amount of edges in a US map (google says average is 150-500

edges), so our runtime will be between O(150+n(log(n)) and O(500+n(log(n)). The runtime for

Prim’s algorithm is formulaically O(Elog(V)) where E is the number of edges (150-500) and V is

the number of vertices.

We will traverse the graph using a Breadth-First Search (BFS), to

take in a starting point, ending point, and output the most efficient (shortest)

route to get from point A to point B, which tourist locations will be visited along the way. The DFS starts at the root node and

explores adjacent nodes. The expected runtime for our BFS search will be O(E + V) as in any BFS.

We will use Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest route, and we will use a DFS to

traverse that route. The dataset will be integrated with the route to output the recommended

road-trip “stops”/destinations along the journey to the end point.
