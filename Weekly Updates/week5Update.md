Start 12/09:

We met three times this week as it was the most crucial week of our project; in these meetings we spent the first 20 minutes sharing what we've completed, the second 20 minutes as an open-debugging session for anyone who was stuck, and the final 20 minutes assigning tasks to complete for the week. We agreed that for the major algorithms, working in 2 sets of 2 pairs would prove more efficient than solo work, so we had Ajay and Pranav work as a team, as well as Sarthak and Jaylen working together. The following is what was assigned to complete this week:

Sarthak and Jaylen:
    - Test suite for Kruskals
    - Test location output
    - Convert Input/Output of function into terminal
    - Finalize graphical output on a US map PNG
Ajay and Pranav:
    -Fixing Dijkstra's algorithm (debugging and making sure output to terminal works)
    - Creating Dijkstras test suite
    - Creating BFS test suite
Misc stuff (all hands on deck):
    - Creating final presentation slideshow
    - Recording final presentation video
    - Check in via email with Amit to make sure there aren't any final issues/concerns that need to be addressed
